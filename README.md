# SetScreenSaver

What is setscreensaver?

	Setscreensaver.sh allows an administrator to set specific settings of all user’s of Mac OS X.  
	The script will modify the User Template along with any current user, overriding their current Screen Saver settings.

What settings can be set?

	The following settings are controlled by this script:
		•	Screensaver module to use
		•	When the screensaver should be activated
		•	Enable or Disable Screenlock ( require password )

Special Thanks:

Thanks to macmule for the initial start of this script.  Was searching for the best way to modify computer screensaver settings for a lab environment.
